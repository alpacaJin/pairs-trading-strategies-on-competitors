# Pairs Trading Strategies On Competitors Bitcoin & Monero To Crowdstrike And Palo Alto Networks

Through pairs trading strategies Correlation and Cointegration, python techniques of normalization, and calculations of stock spreads and spike thresholds, I attempt to examine the behavior of cryptocurrency competitors Bitcoin & Mnoero and cybesecurity stocks CrowdStrike & Palo Alto Networks. In this way, I can make note of intervals of divergence, determine which stock to go short and long in, and turn a profit from that spread. 

The pandemic and years' long resulting recession have had a massive impact on the world of cybersecurity. As cryptocurrency prices surged, it fueled a rise in cyberattacks, due to unregulation and poor traceability. Ransomware, furthermore, has only grown into a multibillion-dollar industry, governed by highly organized groups of criminals, which put America's critical infrastructure at risk.

Thus, while cryptocoins Bitcoin and Monero may be a factor in inciting these malicious acts, cybersecurity companies such as CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks, with their endpoint security, threat intelligence, advanced firewalls and cloud-based services have an active part in protecting our digital way of life. My goal for this project is to examine the relationship these four stocks have with each other and the economy in order to determine how the world may move forward in terms of security.
